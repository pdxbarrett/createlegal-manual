# Typography

CreateLegal generally follows the recommendations of Matthew Butterick in *Typography for Lawyers*, (2d Ed. 2015). These typographic rules (and  departures from those rules) are summarized below. Typographical questions not answered by this summary should follow the recommendations of *Typography for Lawyers.*

These typographic rules apply to documents designed by CreateLegal. Do not correct typography in documents owned or controlled by other counsel or by the client (unless the client has asked for a rewrite). 

### Document Layout

* Only one space between sentences.
* Margins for contracts are 1". Margins for correspondence are 1.25".
* Don't use multiple spaces to move text horizontally (use tab stops).
* Space between paragraphs should be equal to font height (e.g., 12 points between paragraphs when using 12 point font).

### Fonts and Styles

* Use Times New Roman in documents prepared as forms or exchanged with client or other counsel (e.g., form documents, negotiated agreements). 
* Use Equity for other documents (e.g., correspondence, corporate documents).
* Fonts should be 10–12 points in height.
* Never use underlining
* Use *italics* or *bold* to create emphasis.
* Use the ellipsis character (option + semicolon) when creating an ellipses.
* Kerning should be turned on for type sizes of 8 points or above (in Font menu, select Advanced tab, enter 8 in box next to the kerning option).
* E-mail addresses and URLs should not have hyperlinks (turn off under Preferences -> Autocorrect -> Autoformat as You Type).

### Characters

* Quotations and apostrophes use curly marks (“ and ’). Inch and foot designations use straight marks (" and ').
* Use hyphens to break a word between lines, for multipart words (e.g., cost-effective or Section 7-3) or for phrasal adjectives (e.g., commercial-speech).
* Use an en dash (option + hyphen) indicating a range of values (1970 – 2015) or for showing a connection between pairs of words (conservative–liberal).
* Use an em dash (option + shift + hypen) to put a pause in a sentence — a break in a sentence when a comma is too weak.
* Do not use superscripted ordinals (e.g., 1st). Turn off in Word under Preferences -> Autocorrect -> Autoformat as You Type.
* Use proper characters for the copyright symbol (© = option + g), the trademark symbol (™ = option + 2) and the registered trademark symbol (® = option + r).
