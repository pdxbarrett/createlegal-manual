# Principles

# Document Style

CreateLegal generally follows the recommendations of Ken Adams in *A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting*, (3d Ed. 2013) (MSCD). The *MSCD* is voluminous. It is not summarized easily. There are many rules to follow. You'll become more familiar with the rules by using them. So, make an effort to incorporate additional rules into your writing a little at a time. Style questions not answered by this summary should follow the recommendations of *The MSCD*.

These rules should be followed on documents designed by CreateLegal. Do not correct style in documents owned or controlled by other counsel or by the client (unless the client has asked for a rewrite). 

### General Rules

* Do not use stuffy words and legalese. 
* Try to avoid the passive voice.
* Write concisely.

### Technical Rules
* Series should be separated with serial commas (or serial semicolons, as appropriate).
* Forms should be described with the form number separated from the form title by a comma, with the form title in italics  (e.g., Form 2848, *Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative*).

### Contracts

* Section headings (but not section numbers) in contracts should be in italics and separated from section content by a period.
* Use the CreateLegal contract templates for proper paragraph numbering and layout.
* Section titles without content should not be followed by a period.
* The defined term Agreement is capitalized.
* The term "Section" in contract cross-references is capitalized.
* Use automatic cross reference codes.
* For longer documents or documents where it may be important to ensure that changes to the contract body do not affect the signature page, break the signature page from the body of the contract. Conclude the body of this type of contract with [*signature page follows*] on its own line, centered. Follow that with a Section Break (Next Page) to create the signature page.
* Do not use hard returns to move content down a page. Use Section Breaks, Page Breaks and the Keep Together formatting tools.
* Numbers one through ten should be written out in words. Numbers above ten are written using ordinals. Do not use words and numbers (e.g., ten (10) days) to express a number.

### Correspondence
* Do not use "Dear" in salutations. Use the last name for formal correspondence or for unfamiliar addressees (Ms. Smith). Use the first name if the recipient is familiar or if a more conversational tone is appropriate.
* The reference line of a letter (including the *Reference:* introduction) should be italicized.
